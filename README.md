Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in C++






Overview










A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
This project provides a C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree with functionalities to insert, search, and delete nodes.

Classes and Methods
TreeNode Class
This class represents a single node in the binary search tree.
